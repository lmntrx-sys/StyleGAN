👋 Hi, I’m @lmntrx-sys
👀 I’m interested in machine learning and deep learning
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my latest project in which i am creating a website to show
people how recommendation algorithms rank. I would like you to see the ranking process live in the website.
I would really appreciate someone who can help me build the web UI.As i work on the model, but if you can also help me in building the model,
i would really be thankfull.The reason for this project is because as young teenage programmer i have seen my friends fall in rabbit holes which eventually
led to even depression and a dissatisfied  life. I would like eveyone to know how this thing works.
📫 To reach me, reach out to my twitter handle on @lmtrx_sys for any questions
