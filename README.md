This Repository is an implementation of the StyleGAN-2 paper.

StyleGAN-2 is a deep generative model that is trained in an adversarial manner, building upon the foundational idea of adversarial training introduced in the original GAN paper. This adversarial framework has inspired many other generative models, such as CycleGAN and others.

Repository Overview

This implementation is influenced by the Labml.ai repository and follows a modular approach to simplify the understanding of StyleGAN-2's architecture and training process.

File Descriptions

  model.py: Contains the complete model architecture for StyleGAN-2, including the generator, discriminator, and related components.

  loss_penalty.py: Includes the loss functions and penalty terms required for adversarial training.

  training.py: Implements the training loop, bringing together the model, data, and loss components.

  dataset_configs.py: Implements configurations of the dataset

  Training Notes

Hardware Requirements:

  The model is computationally intensive and benefits greatly from a GPU for training.

  The implementation has been tested on the NVIDIA T4 GPU available on Google Colab. For larger batch sizes or faster training, consider using more powerful GPUs, such as the A100.

Resource Management:

  Be cautious of GPU memory usage during training. Overloading the GPU can cause training interruptions and loss of progress.

  Monitor the model's parameter size and batch size to avoid memory overflows.

Training Strategies

Checkpointing:

  Save model weights periodically during training. This allows you to resume training from the last saved state in case of interruptions.

  Use a reliable checkpointing mechanism to ensure progress is not lost.

Alternative Approach:

  For faster training, consider using a paid service to access high-performance GPUs like the NVIDIA A100.

Jupyter Notebook

  The entire training process—from data preparation to generating results—is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. This is designed for execution in Google Colab for ease of use and accessibility.

Additional Notes

  Medium Blog Post:
  For a deeper understanding of StyleGAN-2, check out my blog post on Medium. It explains the architecture of the generator and discriminator, as well as the key refinements introduced in StyleGAN-2 compared to the original StyleGAN.

General Information

StyleGAN-2 is renowned for its ability to generate high-quality, photorealistic images. It introduces key innovations, such as weight demodulation, to improve image quality and stability.

  This implementation aims to be as faithful as possible to the original paper, while also providing clear and modular code for easier learning and experimentation.

  The repository is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in advanced GAN architectures or exploring StyleGAN-2 as a base model for other generative tasks.
